									 <p><b>My Hometown：</b></p>
									<p>Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, is a beautiful world of ice and snow. Also known as: Little Paris of the East. There are not only multi-cultural buildings, but also endless delicious food. The people in my hometown are very hospitable, and the summer scenery is beautiful and the climate is cool. You can play in the snow in winter! If there is a chance, come to Harbin to find me to play !

								<p>
									My second hometown is Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. It is a beautiful coastal city, known as the "Oriental Hawaii" reputation. There are not only vast seas, golden beaches, but also rolling green hills. In summer, we go surfing in the sea, and there are beautiful shells on the beach. In winter, you can see seagulls on the trestle. Then you can watch a perfect sunset on the beach. If you like beer and seafood friends, you must come to Qingdao to travel, because there are pure original beer and fresh seafood in the sea, I am waiting for you in Qingdao!
