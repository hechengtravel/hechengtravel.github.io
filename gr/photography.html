					On normal holidays, I like to listen to music, travel and take pictures of different sunrise and sunset every day. My favorite singer is Zhiqian Xue ----Joker, because I think his songs are very empowering, but also my lucky song, every time before the exam I will listen to his "reading" and "worship", which makes me very excited.

					Every day sunrise and sunset are very beautiful, there are all kinds of colors, if today is very unhappy, looking at such beautiful scenery, it is estimated that it will be a lot of comfort!
					Travel will see different scenery, can feel different cultures and exotic customs, eat a variety of delicious. I have seen snow-capped mountains, golden tops, sea of clouds, stars and countless beauty. I really like the pace of life in the UK, which makes me feel very comfortable, listening to English folk songs walking in the streets of the UK, leaves falling, there is a lovely ice cream truck next to it, it is just a yearning life! British ice cream is really good! I hope I can see the most beautiful aurora next year!
